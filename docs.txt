Objective to overcome:

A lot of Engineering Students struggle with writing their thesis at the end of their degree as they did not practice academic writing nor
writing in general. ThesisAI is a tool that helps students train their AI (finetune ChatGPT) model based onn their provided Background papers to help them with their Thesis.
ThesisAI will extract the text fro the academic papers provided and transform it into a JSONlines document needed to finetune ChatGPT.
ThesisAI will provide detailed instruction how to prevent plagiatism in academmic writing.
ThesisAI wants to leverage AI and incorporate in into the process of writing a THesis so people can make something AWESOME.
ThesisAI is NOT a tool automate the Thesis.
ThesisAI is a tool to potentially make life easier especially for Engineering students.
We will provide detailed explanation and workflow in the ThesisAI Workflow and White Paper.



Corporate Identity:

ThesisAI is a tool to excel at your acedemic Tasks. Is is not a tool to be lazy. It is a tool that lets you focus on your engineering project rather than focusing ont writing.
You are an engineer. Not a writer. ThesisAI promotes thinking outside the box and trying new things.
